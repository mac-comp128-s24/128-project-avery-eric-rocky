# Akinator clone
Made by Avery Eric and Rocky for COMP 128 final project.

Our game is smaller scale version of the popular webgame Akinator. To play, just run the Game class and click the "Start Game" button. There is a "How to Play" button on the main screen that will guide you through how to play the game. There is also a "Tree Viewer" button which allows the user to view the tree that is generated and used to play each round of the game.
